# image_classification
Image classification for MRI brain tumour and galaxy zoo datasets.

Three classification algorithms were used: convolutional neural network (CNN), quantum transfer learning (QTL) and support vector machine (SVM).

The brain tumour MRI dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).

Galaxy zoo data can be accessed [here](https://data.galaxyzoo.org/).
